# Networking Basics for Cybersecurity

## What is a Network?
A network is a group of connected devices that communicate.

## Network Types
- Private Network
- Public Network (Internet)

## Why Networking Matters
- Traffic analysis
- Intrusion detection

- # Networking Basics for Cybersecurity

## What is Networking?
If two or more devices can connect to each other and transfer data, this is called a **computer network**.  
The study and implementation of how these devices connect and communicate is known as **networking**.

Networking forms the **foundation of all cyber attacks and defensive strategies**.  
Without understanding networking, it is impossible to properly detect, analyze, or respond to cyber incidents.

## Why Networking is Important in Cybersecurity
Networking gives us **visibility into how systems communicate**, which helps in:

- Understanding how many devices and IPs exist in a network
- Detecting suspicious or malicious traffic
- Creating effective **incident response plans**
- Containing attacks like **ransomware**
- Isolating (quarantining) one infected asset while protecting others
- Preventing full network compromise in small and large organizations

Without networking knowledge, defenders cannot properly respond to attacks or protect critical assets.

## History of the Internet (Brief)
Originally, there were **no phones, no modern communication systems**.  
The internet started as a military research project called **ARPANET**, developed by the **Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)**.

The goal was to create a network that could still function even if parts of it were destroyed.  
Over time, this evolved into the modern **Internet**, often described as a:

> **“Network of Networks”**

The **World Wide Web (WWW)** later enabled global information sharing.

## Types of Computer Networks

### LAN (Local Area Network)
- Small geographical area (home, office, college)
- Example: Wi-Fi in a house

### WAN (Wide Area Network)
- Large geographical area
- Example: The Internet

### MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- Covers a city or large campus
- Example: City-wide ISP networks

### PAN (Personal Area Network)
- Very short range
- Example: Bluetooth connection between phone and earphones

## Data Transfer Terms

### Latency
- Time taken for data to travel from source to destination
- Lower latency = faster response

### Bandwidth
- Maximum amount of data that can be transmitted per second

### Throughput
- Actual speed of data transfer
- Usually less than bandwidth due to overhead

### Jitter
- Variation in data packet delivery time
- High jitter affects voice and video communication

## Network Topology
**Topology** refers to the arrangement and structure of devices in a network.

### Ring Topology
- Devices connected in a circular manner
- Commonly used in some industrial environments

### Mesh Topology
- Devices are interconnected with multiple paths
- Highly resilient and fault-tolerant
- Commonly used in **military and critical systems**

## Cybersecurity Perspective
Understanding networking allows security professionals to:
- Monitor traffic flow
- Detect anomalies
- Respond to attacks efficiently
- Design secure and resilient networks

Networking is not optional in cybersecurity — **it is the base layer of everything**.
